/**
 * Description:
 * The CANdle MultiAnimation example demonstrates using multiple animations with CANdle.
 * This example has the robot using a Command Based template to control the CANdle.
 * 
 * This example uses:
 * - A CANdle wired on the CAN Bus, with a 5m led strip attached for the extra animatinos.
 * 
 * Controls (with Xbox controller):
 * Right Bumper: Increment animation
 * Left Bumper: Decrement animation
 * Start Button: Switch to setting the first 8 LEDs a unique combination of colors
 * POV Right: Configure maximum brightness for the CANdle
 * POV Down: Configure medium brightness for the CANdle
 * POV Left: Configure brightness to 0 for the CANdle
 * POV Up: Change the direction of Rainbow and Fire, must re-select the animation to take affect
 * A: Print the VBat voltage in Volts
 * B: Print the 5V voltage in Volts
 * X: Print the current in amps
 * Y: Print the temperature in degrees C
 * 
 * This example uses a development build based on 5.21.2.
 * 
 * Supported Version:
 * 	- CANdle: 22.1.1.0
